## Value Proposition

### Integration and Automation
- By leveraging AI agents for computational tasks, you can significantly automate and streamline your analytics processes.
- Utilizing the Giza SDK and zkSync protocols for developing these agents ensures compatibility with decentralized protocols and enhances the scalability of your solutions.

### Agent Competition
- Having AI agents compete against each other could enhance performance and efficiency. This competitive environment can drive the optimization of strategies and algorithms.
- Evaluating these agents from a security perspective will ensure that they are robust and free from vulnerabilities, enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness.

### Ethics and Fair Play
- Including ethical guidelines in your evaluation criteria will set a standard for responsible AI usage, fostering a trustworthy and fair competitive environment.

## Feasibility and Generalization

### Generalizing AI Agents
- Your approach to cataloging and generalizing AI agents within the WebTrey system is feasible. You can create a unified interface and repository for various types of agents, allowing for easy deployment and management.
- The use of standardized documentation, reproducible code, and extensive business case analysis will facilitate the integration of these agents into a cohesive system.

### AI Agent Overview and Configuration
- The wireframe's focus on providing an overview and configuration options for AI agents is crucial. Ensure that the interface is user-friendly and allows for detailed monitoring and configuration of each agent.
- Metrics such as transaction execution, success rates, and performance over time will provide valuable insights for continuous improvement.

## Specific Bounty Details

### Giza Agent
- **Focus:** Develop a smart strategy using verifiable ML model predictions. Ensure that your agent can interact with smart contracts efficiently and execute on-chain transactions based on these predictions.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the agent on a supported testnet and document the entire process comprehensively.

### Koi Finance Agent
- **Focus:** Develop advanced on-chain strategies for Koi Finance on zkSync. Your agent should focus on managing liquidity pools and farming pools effectively.
- **Deployment:** Proof of successful transactions and thorough documentation will be key to qualifying for this bounty.

### Linea Sepolia Agent
- **Focus:** Develop an AI Agent using the Giza SDK that manages a smart strategy developed on top of a decentralized protocol on Linea Sepolia.
- **Deployment:** Deploy your Agent on Linea Sepolia, with proof of successful transaction, or deploy your endpoint for Verifiable Inference. If you donâ€™t have a fully implemented agent, you must submit the action design for Agent, Protocol interaction Scope, and Specs for smart contracts.
- **Documentation:** Extensive documentation (agent business case, functionality, attack vectors, possible improvements) is required.

## Recommendations

### Documentation and Source Code
- Maintain high standards for your documentation and ensure that your source code is clean, reproducible, and well-documented.
- Highlight the business case, functionality, and potential attack vectors in your documentation.

### Security Evaluations
- Regularly evaluate your agents for security vulnerabilities. Implement automated testing tools and manual code reviews to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- Consider integrating a threat intelligence board to stay updated on emerging threats and enhance your security posture.

### Ethical Considerations
- Develop a set of ethical guidelines for AI agent behavior. Ensure that these guidelines are adhered to during the development and deployment phases.
- Transparency in AI decision-making processes will build trust and credibility with users and stakeholders.

By following these guidelines and focusing on robust development, documentation, and security practices, you can effectively integrate and utilize AI agents within the Netsoul WebTrey system, positioning yourselves strongly in the Agents of Gizathon hackathon and beyond.
